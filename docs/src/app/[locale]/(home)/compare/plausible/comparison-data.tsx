    "Plausible is a well-respected privacy-first analytics tool known for its clean dashboard and lightweight script. It's a great choice for websites that want simple traffic metrics without cookies or consent banners. But Plausible stays close to basic web analytics: there's no session replay, error tracking, or Web Vitals monitoring, and funnels and user journeys are reserved for its Business plan.",
    "Rybbit shares Plausible's commitment to privacy and simplicity but goes significantly further. You get funnels and user journeys on every plan, plus Web Vitals monitoring, error tracking, and session replay on the Pro plan. Beyond visit counts, you can see how people navigate your site, where they drop off, and what errors they encounter.",
    "Both platforms are open source and self-hostable, and both run on ClickHouse; Rybbit's stack is TypeScript, Plausible's is Elixir. Rybbit uses events-based pricing that includes all interaction types, while Plausible charges by pageviews only. If you like Plausible's privacy-first approach but need deeper analytics to grow your product, Rybbit gives you that depth without giving up simplicity.",

          <>
            Plausible deserves real credit here: it pioneered the modern privacy-first analytics category and proved
            that teams would pay for cookieless traffic stats instead of tolerating Google Analytics. Its scope is
            deliberately minimal: a clean dashboard of pageviews, sources, and goals, with no session replay, no
            error tracking, and no user profiles. That restraint is a feature, not an oversight; Plausible has never
            pretended to be a product-analytics tool.
          </>,
          <>
            Rybbit starts from the same privacy foundation (cookieless tracking with a daily-rotating salt, open
            source, free to <Link href="/docs/self-hosting">self-host</Link>) but takes the opposite position on
            scope. It ships <Link href="/features/session-replay">session replay</Link>,{" "}
            <Link href="/features/funnels">funnels</Link>,{" "}
            <Link href="/features/user-journeys">user journeys</Link>, error tracking, Web Vitals, and user profiles as
            part of the core product. The honest framing: Plausible tells you how much traffic you got and where it
            came from; Rybbit also shows you what visitors did once they arrived, where they dropped off, and what
            broke.

        paragraphs: [
          <>
            Plausible prices by monthly pageviews, with plan tiers gating sites and seats: Starter is $9/month for 10k
            pageviews and a single site, Growth is $14/month for 3 sites and 3 team members, and Business is $19/month
            for 10 sites and 10 members, with 2 months free if you pay annually. It&apos;s cheap to start, but growing
            past a site or seat cap means a plan change even if your traffic hasn&apos;t moved.
          </>,
          <>
            Rybbit prices by events (from $19/month for 100k events). Funnels, journeys, error tracking, and Web
            Vitals are on every plan, so you never upgrade just to unlock funnels; session replay and unlimited sites
            and seats come with Pro. At low traffic Plausible is the cheaper bill; once you&apos;d otherwise be
            paying for replay, funnels, and error tracking as separate tools, the math flips. Full details are on the{" "}
            <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link>. And both products keep an honest exit: Plausible&apos;s
            Community Edition and Rybbit&apos;s open-source version are each free to self-host.

            This is one migration where you don&apos;t start from zero: Rybbit has a built-in data importer for
            Plausible, so your historical traffic comes with you instead of living in an old dashboard forever.

              Add the Rybbit tracking script alongside Plausible&apos;s. Both are lightweight, and running them
              in parallel for a while costs nothing but a few kilobytes.

              Import your Plausible history with the <Link href="/docs/data-import">data importer</Link>, so year-over-year

            If a traffic dashboard is genuinely all you want, Plausible is an excellent one, arguably the best
            at being exactly that. It has the longest track record in the category, an EU-owned and EU-hosted cloud, a
            famously tiny script (Plausible advertises it as 54&times; smaller than Google Analytics; Rybbit&apos;s is
            around 11KB compressed), and a 30-day trial with no card required versus Rybbit&apos;s 7 days. Choosing it means
            going without session replay and error tracking (and paying for its Business plan to get funnels), and
            for plenty of content sites and blogs, that&apos;s the right call. If you&apos;re weighing more options
